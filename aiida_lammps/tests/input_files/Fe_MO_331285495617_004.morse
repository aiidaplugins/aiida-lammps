# Row 1: `rcut' cutoff value in Angstroms
# Row 2: Morse `epsilon' value in eV
# Row 3: Morse `C' value in 1/Angstroms
# Row 4: Morse `Rzero' value in Angstroms
# (See README for Pair_Morse_Shifted__MD_552566534109_001 for further details.)

# Parameters (epsilon, C, Rzero) for Fe taken from:

#
# The cutoff radius is computed so that
#
# phi(rcut)=tol*|phi(rmin)|,   (*)
#
# where phi(r) is the Morse potential, 'rcut' is the cutoff radius,
# `rmin' is the radius at which phi(r) is a minimum, and
# `tol' is a small number.  Here, (*) is solved numerically for `rcut'.
#
# `cutoff' in this file is for a "Low" tolerance of tol = 1.00000e-02.
